# company-intro-site

A company introduction site built during my HTML & CSS learning. Based on Elzero Web School tutorials, but fully redesigned with custom colors, fonts, and elements. Images from Pinterest, logo made with ChatGPTâ€™s help. Goal: turn ideas into real UI and improve my front-end skills.
